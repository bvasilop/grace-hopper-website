# Grace Hopper Website
A project designed to demonstrate the ability to manipulate the DOM by creating, removing and modifying elements.

## Basic Features
*  a pseudo-login with some mock user data when the user clicks the "login" button.
*  "View details" buttons so that they show the appropriate hidden content (marked with the `details` class) when clicked, and then hide the same content when clicked again.
  * Alter the text of the "view details" button that was clicked so it becomes "hide details" and allows the user to understand that these buttons work to toggle the display of content.
* Activate the vote buttons so they properly register, count, and display voting activity.
